Hey there, I'm Jay Shah. I'm a software developer currently living in San Francisco, California.

I created this blog to write about my experiences, share my technical knowledge, and to have something to look back on when I'm older.

### Background

I was born in Mumbai, India and moved to the US when I was seven years old.
I grew up in the Bay Area after short stints in New Jersey and Chicago.

As I grew up, I had a hard time figuring out who I wanted to be or what I wanted to do.
I joined clubs, played sports, and picked up any extracurriculars that I came across.
All in the hope that I would discover my passion.

Fortunately, I'm still on that search today. I say fortunately because I've come to embrace my search.
It's led me to pick up a number of hobbies and skills that have provided me with unique perspectives.
As I continue down my path, I hope to create things that are valuable to the world.
Until then, I'll be obsessing over my current hobbies and projects until I find the next thing to do.

### Education

I attended the University of California, Davis and graduated with a bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering.

### Work

Currently a software engineer working at [DataGrail](https://www.datagrail.io/){:target="_blank"}.
In the past, I've worked at [Sisense](https://sisense.com){:target="_blank"}, [Workday](https://workday.com){:target="_blank"}, [Splunk](https://splunk.com){:target="_blank"},
