Hey there, I'm Jay Shah. I'm a software developer currently living in San Francisco, California.

I created this blog to write about my experiences, share my technical knowledge, and to have something to look back on when I'm older.

### Background

I was born in Mumbai, India and moved to the US when I was seven years old. I initially lived in New Jersey and Chicago for a short time and decided the cold wasn't for me.
I ultimately ended up moving to and growing up in the Bay Area.

As I grew up, I had a hard time figuring out who I wanted to be or what I wanted to do.
I joined clubs, played sports, and picked up any extracurriculars that I came across. All in the hope that
I would discover my passion.

Fortunately, I'm still on that search today. I say fortunately because I've come to embrace my search. It's led me to pick up a number of hobbies and skills that
have provided me with opportunity. As I continue down my path, I hope to create things that are valuable to the world. Until then, I'll
be obsessing over my current hobbies and projects until I find the next thing to do.
