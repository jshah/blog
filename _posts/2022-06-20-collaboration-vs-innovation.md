You’ve probably heard the proverb “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” It’s a powerful proverb and useful if you know which one you want, but what if you want both? There is an inflection point where you have a tradeoff between speed and progress, like a demand curve. Is there a way we can bend the rules to our benefit?

At early-stage startups, I’ve seen a similar tradeoff exist between collaboration and innovation. Teams that are trying to solve a problem and innovate a solution want to move fast but they also want to do it together. It’s a reasonable expectation as startups are fighting to survive but also want each member to have knowledge for the longer term.

This poses a dilemma as innovation usually comes in a form of creative solutions that no one has thought of or wasn’t possible before. When bringing together a group that collaborates to solve a problem, they usually don’t come up with the best solution. From this [study](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/improving-the-rhythm-of-your-collaboration/) from MIT Sloan, “groups with constant interaction were the most consistent, producing a higher average quality of solution but finding the very best ones much less frequently”. In other words, solving a problem as a group will slow you down on your way to finding the most innovative solution.

## The Problem at Startups

From my experience, I’ve seen startups prioritize either collaboration or innovation. Collaborative startups sacrifice creativity and productivity to make sure all members are working together towards a solution. Innovative startups sacrifice communication and teamwork in search of the best solution. Both are missing critical strategies that can improve their output.

### Characteristics of Collaborative Startups

Some characteristics of startups that over-optimize for collaboration might include:
- Group meetings for every stage of a project. Idea conception, fact-gathering, ideating, and iterating all involve lengthy meetings where everyone must be in the know and on the same page.
- No free time to think and ideate away from your peers. There aren’t lengthy blocks of time where you can think without the influence of your peers (we’re talking days, not hours).
- Having to communicate with your team on each instance of progress or every aspect of your day. This could include emails, slack messages, or any other form of communication that builds visibility and synergy.

While I am a huge fan of collaboration and involving my peers in the journey, these characteristics harm your team. Over collaboration can burden your team and take away from independent thinking. You’ve hired smart people to help drive your organization forward, you also need to give them the space to think through problems in their own environment and in their own framework. For example, my best ideas come in the shower or on long walks. If I don’t have space to do that, you will be underutilizing my skillset.

### Characteristics of Innovative Startups

Some characteristics of startups that over-optimize for innovation might include:
- Organizations that value individuals who just ship code. These individuals tend to “cowboy” features and show the finished product but not the decisions or work that went into creating the product.
- Individuals who create the most optimized and efficient solution without understanding the problem they are solving. There are intelligent people who are creating a solution for a problem that doesn’t exist.
- Organizations that fix problems for any customer that has an issue without taking into context the product vision. These one-off fixes display agility and the ability to fix problems, but in the long term, they can harm your business model and team productivity.

Innovation requires creativity, imagination, and out-of-the-box thinking but these characteristics misrepresent what an organization actually needs. These characteristics lack a foundational piece of context and information that can be gathered from stakeholders and peers. Every company wants to be the most innovative company but the direction needs to come from industry experience or factual information.

## Getting The Best of Both Worlds

To get the best of both worlds, there are two main learning actions that we have to be aware of. The first is the act of gathering information and the second is the act of figuring out the best solution. The first act requires collaboration and the second act requires innovation. You need to make time for both in a harmonic rhythm. From the MIT study, “Groups that interacted intermittently — with a true rhythm of collaboration — broke the trade-off, capturing the best of both worlds rather than succumbing to the worst of either one.”

The specific change required for your company will vary but the idea is to create a space where your team can collaborate and can also take time away to use the information gained from collaborating to innovate. Collaboration will feed into innovation and innovation will feed into collaboration creating a harmonic cycle.

Some ideas to create this harmonic rhythm:
- Create true no meeting days that last more than one day. Makers adhere to the Maker’s Schedule and not the Manager’s Schedule and need more than a few hours or days to innovate.
- Collaboration sessions should be to share factual information and experiences around learnings. This will allow others on the team to learn from each other without biasing towards any one solution.
- Encourage individuals to create throw-away prototypes, go backward, and break things. This fosters an environment where you can be nimble and react to new information and ideas.

I’ll leave with this quote from the MIT study and will allow you to form your own ideas: “Too little communication, and there’s no learning and no synergy. Too much communication, and all the minds end up in the same place, focusing on the same types of solutions.”
